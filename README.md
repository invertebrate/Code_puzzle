# Code_puzzle
Simple c++ programming puzzle game with lua scripting integration.  

The goal of this projects was to familiarize myself with the lua C api and scripting for games.
The first stage is meant to be a simple puzzle game that has the player write a sequence of inputs as "code" for the player object to perform.
The long term vision is to make a "hacking" game where the player controls the game with simplified commands and scripts trying to beat imaginary cyber security implementations.

This project uses lua library binaries. Please read the lua_copyright_notice file for details.
